# JavaScript-Portfolio-Poject-Art-Gallery_app

## Overview

The Art-Gallery-App is a single-page application for creating and managing paintings and artists. Users can add new paintings with images from a Google Custom Search Engine, create artists, and delete records as needed. All data operations are handled by a backend API.

## Requirements

- Any modern web browser
- Optional: a local web server such as `npx http-server`

## Local Development

1. Clone this repository.
2. From the project root run `npx http-server` and open the provided URL in your browser. You can alternatively open `index.html` directly without a server.

## Backend API

This frontend expects a backend available at `https://artster-api.herokuapp.com/api` that exposes CRUD endpoints for artists and paintings.
